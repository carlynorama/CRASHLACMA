1. We project a map of Los Angeles.
2. People come by and give us their zip code, or an intersection near where they live.
3. Google maps generates the public transit route from that point to LACMA.  We can also keep a running total of the transit time.
4. People traces over that projected map with a marker.
5. Robots (DIY version) move over the marked routes.  As more routes are drawn the more random it looks like for the robots meandering around the city map.
